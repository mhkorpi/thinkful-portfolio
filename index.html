        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
          <p>I was introduced to web and software development in high school, but because I had played the violin since I was five years old, I earned a music degree in college. But after graduation, gig work like driving for Lyft and Uber provided a more reliable source of income than musical pursuits.</p>
          <p>However, after five years they became more of a grind with less and less financial incentive. In May of 2017, with the intention of seeking a more in-demand career path, I enrolled in a software development course at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, which was Bloc.io at the time.</p>
          <p>I still hadn't found the right motivation yet, though, and I quit after a few months to become a live-in caregiver. Finally, in 2020 I met my <strong><em>why</em></strong>, and now we have a one-year-old daughter.</p>
          <p>I have always known that my mind is my greatest asset. Now that I'm equipped with the proper purpose and support, I'm ready for the challenge!</p>
